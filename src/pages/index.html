            Hello! My name is Tyler Bazemore, I am 22 years old and currently getting a degree in Software Development from Eastern Florida State College. 
            I love the process of coding and making my own projects and this website is also one of them to better my self at languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
            <hr style="opacity:0">
            This website will display some of the different projects I have from from games to different encryption ciphers.
