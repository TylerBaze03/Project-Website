            1. <a href="https://github.com/TylerBaze03/FauxHollowsRandom" class = "pText">Faux Hollows</a><br>

            <p class = "projects-p">A python script written to generate and create a small game based off of the one in Final Fantasy XIV 
            in which the player tries to uncover 2 or possibly 3 objects of varying sizes(usually 1 2x3 object and 1 2x2 object with a chance of there being a 1x1 which would give the player more points).
            This project was useful in becoming overall more comfortable with using modules and using some DFS/BFS like elements into the random generation of the board the player will selecting randomly from.
            </p>

            2. <a href="https://github.com/TylerBaze03/Cipher-Collection" class = "pText">Ciphers</a><br>
            <p class = "projects-p">This projects contain differnet ciphers as well as test files to try out ones I have found or for you to make your own with the correct formatting. I first found an interest in ciphers
                in my security in computing class in which we had to create a cipher and chose the Hills cipher. I really enjoyed this project and it motivated me to learn about other encryption techniques and to try and 
                form my own solution in accordance to the rules posed by them. Currently on includes the Hills cipher and Playfair cipher but i plan to add more in different languages. 
            </p>

            3. <a href="https://github.com/TylerBaze03/Discord-Banned-Words-Bot" class = "pText">Discord Bot</a><br>
            <p class = "projects-p">I wanted to create a discord Bot and a project using GoLang and I thought this could be a perfect match as I had recently come across and API that allowed for easier coding of a discord bot using GoLang.
                This, as with the Faux Hollows project, helped me gain more familiarity with GoLangs modules and how to properly utilized them in creating a scalable and easily interchangeable project, as you need to keep track of the bots
                authorization keys throughout the program to make it work. Making this project also gave me more insight into working with APIs and implementing them into my own code. 
            </p>

            4. <a href="https://github.com/TylerBaze03/Project-Website" class = "pText">This Website!</a><br>
            <p class = "projects-p">This website it self has been one large project in order to get me more familiar with front end development languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Creating and learning how to fully utilize and implement JavaScript 
                as well as CSS into my HTML pages has been enjoyable as well as quite the learn curve as there so many information sources and solutions for similar problems, and they all claim to be the best! However, it has been 
                still very enjoyable after getting used to the syntax and mechanics of inter-weaving the multiple languages. Also, learning the skills to make a website
                and understand the different elements that go into it are very important for trying to go into the software engineering field, which is quite valuable.
